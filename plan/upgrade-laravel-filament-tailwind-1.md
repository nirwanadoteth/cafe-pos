## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Perform incremental upgrades (one package at a time); not chosen due to interdependencies and efficiency.
- **ALT-002**: Migrate to a different admin UI or CSS framework; not chosen to maintain project continuity and minimize risk.

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: Composer (PHP package manager)
- **DEP-002**: NPM (Node package manager)
- **DEP-003**: PHP 8.2+ runtime
- **DEP-004**: MySQL database

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: composer.json (update Laravel and Filament requirements)
- **FILE-002**: package.json (update Tailwind CSS requirement)
- **FILE-003**: All PHP source files affected by breaking changes
- **FILE-004**: All Blade and Filament UI files affected by breaking changes
- **FILE-005**: Configuration files (config/*.php, tailwind.config.js, vite.config.js)
- **FILE-006**: Documentation files (README.md, architecture.md, tech-stack.md)

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Run PHPUnit automated test suite
- **TEST-002**: Manual UI and workflow testing for admin and cashier roles
- **TEST-003**: Validate asset compilation and UI rendering
- **TEST-004**: Security and regression testing

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Breaking changes in Laravel, Filament, or Tailwind CSS may require significant refactoring
- **RISK-002**: Third-party packages may not be compatible with new versions
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: All custom code is compatible or can be refactored for new versions
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Adequate test coverage exists to validate upgrade
