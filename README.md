# Cafe POS System

A modern, extensible Point-of-Sale (POS) application for cafes, built with the latest Laravel 12.x, Filament 4.x, and Tailwind CSS v4.x technology stack. It provides robust order management, reporting, and admin features with a clean, modular architecture and developer-friendly workflow.

**ðŸŽ‰ Recently Upgraded:** Successfully completed comprehensive upgrade to Laravel 12.x/Filament 4.x/Tailwind v4.x with enhanced performance, security, and modern UI features.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** PHP 8.2+ (Laravel 12.x)
- **Frontend:** Blade, Filament (4.x), Vite (7.x), TailwindCSS (4.1), JavaScript (ESM)
- **Database:** MySQL/SQLite
- **Testing:** PHPUnit (11.5), PHPStan (level 8), Pint (1.24)
- **Build Tools:** Composer, NPM
- **Other:** Spatie Media Library, Filament plugins, FakerPHP

See [tech-stack.md](.github/copilot/tech-stack.md) for details.

## Project Architecture

- Layered MVC (Model-View-Controller) with Service/Repository patterns
- Modular organization: Models, Controllers, Policies, Providers, Enums, Factories, Migrations
- Filament for admin UI (component-based)
- Clear separation of concerns, extensibility, and security via policy-based authorization

See [architecture.md](.github/copilot/architecture.md) for full overview and diagrams.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL 5.7+ or SQLite
- Node.js (for frontend assets)

### Installation

```sh
composer install
npm install
```

### Setup

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure database and environment variables
- Run migrations and seeders:

```sh
php artisan migrate --seed
```

- Build frontend assets with Tailwind v4:

```sh
npm run build
```

- Start the development server:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

### Development Workflow (Updated for v4 Stack)

The project now uses the latest technology stack with enhanced development experience:

```sh
# Run all development services concurrently
composer dev

# Or individually:
php artisan serve          # Laravel development server  
npm run dev               # Vite dev server with Tailwind v4
php artisan queue:listen  # Queue worker
php artisan pail          # Real-time log monitoring
```
